Thanks.…. Consider this - the game was a lie. previous 'suicides' didn't involve a choice. The cabbie just forced each 'suicide' to take a poisoned pill at gunpoint. A choice between dying painlessly or violently and bleeding out in pain. We only have his word that he would give them a choice and take a pill himself.

I just finshed watching the first episode in the first season of sherlock after hearing such good reviews about it. I couldn't quite figure one thing out though. The murderer says he offers the victims a 50% choice between taking 2 pills. One is said to be lethal and one is said to be non-lethal. So my questions are as follows. 1.
